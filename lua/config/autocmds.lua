-- Autocmds are automatically loaded on the VeryLazy event
-- Default autocmds that are always set: https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/blob/main/lua/lazyvim/config/autocmds.lua
-- Add any additional autocmds here

-- Almost similar to vim.opt.autochdir = true but did not work
-- vim.cmd("cd %:p:h")
